Command 1: r
    This command runs the program until a breakpoint or an error.
    This was the first command I used so that I could ensure that the 
    program had no errors in it and would fully execute.

Command 2: b main
    This command inserts a breakpoint at the main() function.
    This was the second command I used so that I could begin stepping
    through the program and analyze the program without it fully executing.

Command 3: s 
    This command runs the next line of the program.
    This was the third command I used so that I could step through the 
    program one line at a time.

Command 4: p i
    The p command prints out the value of the variable name given.
    This was the fourth command I used so that I could check on the value
    of i at each stage of the program.

Command 5: c 
    This continues the program until it reaches a breakpoint or an error.
    This was the 5th command I ran once I got past the printf statement as 
    continuing to use s was running native C code for the printf function.
